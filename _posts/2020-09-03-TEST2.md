> Warning: Work in Progress!

> This is an opinionated technology blog. Posts are about technologies that are interesting to me.

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built  blogs from scratch or used   blog technology du jour. This blog is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai). It is a tool in [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Synopsis

-  Fastpages is not plug and play

- It requires:

    - Experience using git

    - Experince using GitHub

- The documentation is a guide, not step by step

My experience installing and using fastpages was worth while. I have learned things also.

## Git and GitHub

Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are integral to fastpages. Fastpages relies on GitHub for hosting the blog repository, Github Pages to compile and deploy the blog, and Github Actions to automate  blog creation  

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a key structural component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in a project's files. It helps answering the questions: Who Changed What, Where, When, and Why?

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform for hosting  versions of most any type of file. Think of GitHub as a platform that stores the files in a remote repository. It comes with tools to collaborate on projects of any size.

[Git Hub Pages](https://pages.github.com) are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub

    <em>A Process for Creating Fastpages Posts</em>
</p>

## Fastpages Posts

[Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://fastpages.fast.ai),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

Fastpages uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to create and deploy blogs. It uses [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that  has some features  other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown, and supporting embedding HTML

## VScode

I use VScode for blog command and control,  text editing, and interfacing with git and GitHub.

My go to editor is [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com)  for blog command and control,  text editing, and interfacing with git and GitHub.   The [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) extension pack is a convenient feature for  previewing  GitHub markdown blog posts while typing.
 
The VScode [Docker Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) enables  previewing the  entire fastpages blog. This is a much faster way of seeing  blog changes than pushing them to the GitHub Repository

## Local Repository

The local repository contains a copy the GitHub repository. Contents are edited using VScode. The GitHub repository is not directly updated. It is updated after edited files are saved, staged, a message is added, and pushed  to the GitHub repository. 

One can use the built-in terminal to manually update the GitHub repository with the updated files in the local repository. The `git add` command stages the edited  files.  The `git commit -m "message"` command adds the "why" message. The `git push` command pushes the edited files to the GitHub repository. I prefer using the VScode built-in GitHub interface.  It is quicker  and checks for errors. Microsoft owns both GitHub and VScode.

The local repository is updated with the `git pull` command. It ensures the local repository is  up to date with the GitHub repository. 

## GitHub Chain

Fastpages relies on a cast of creative APIs, and apps to compile and deploy blogs

GitHub Repository -> Fastpages -> Github Pages -> Deploy Blog

GitHub notifies fastpages after a push from the local repository. Fastpages does what is necessary for GitHub Pages to compile and deploy the blog

## GitHub Pages

- compose blogs on your computer and save it to your local GitHub repository blog repository

- save a copy to the local GitHub repository to the GitHub repository.

- GitHub saves all versions of the changes to the repository.

- information about who changed what, when, where, and why, is stored in repository 

- Fastpages  automatically compiles  blog  posting from the repository

- the top of the blog post page has links to the blog About page, a search link for the entire blog,  a link to all blog tags, and a link to the blog home page

 - links to all blog postings are added to the blog home page, with post title, description, and date added to the blog

- clicking a blog posting link opens the posting

- a table of contents is 
shown for each section of the blog post
