            "content": "Updated: . Warning: Work in Progress! . This is an opinionated technology blog about technologies of interest to me . Since the early days of the Internet, I have built blogs from scratch or used blog technology du jour. This blog is built using fastpages, a tool in fast.ai’s tool kit . How fitting. The first blog post is about the blog . Synopsis . fastpages is not plug and play . | It requires: . Experience using git . | Experience using GitHub . | . | The documentation is a guide, not step by step . | . My experience installing and using fastpages was worth while. I have learned things too . Git . Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are integral to fastpages. It relies on git to push file changes to the blog GitHub repository , GitHub Pages to compile and deploy the blog, and GitHub Actions for blog creation automation . Git is a key structural component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track project file changes. It helps answering the questions: Who Changed What, Where, When, and Why? Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens on the local computer. . GitHub is an online platform for hosting versions of most type of files. GitHub is a platform for storing files in a remote repository that is a unified source of truth . Git Hub Pages creates and deploys public web pages . Some Helpful Resources . Set up Git . Getting started with GitHub . Git and GitHub in a Nutshell: Definitive tutorial for beginners . Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub . From Edits to Web Blog . The diagram illustrates creating blog posts from editing to deploying blogs . . A Process for Creating Fastpages Posts . Fastpages Posts . Fastpages supports creating blog post using Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Microsoft Word . Fastpages uses GitHub Pages to create and deploy blogs. It uses GitHub Flavored Markdown for editing blog post text. Fastpages can be configured to use kramdown. It adds features other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown, and supporting embedding HTML . VScode . VScode is my go-to editor for blog command and control, text editing, and interfacing with git and GitHub. The Github Markdown Preview extension pack is convenient for previewing GitHub markdown blog posts while editing . The VScode Docker Etension uses Docker. It enables previewing the entire fastpages blog from any git branch with out a git push. This is a much faster and safer way to view the blog while writing posts, without disturbing the the blog public view. One can edit several blog posts in different git branches, and quickly review them. This is possible because the extension has a web server. When a blog post is ready for public viewing, merge it with the git master branch, and push it to the GitHub Repository to update the public view. . So, with VScode extensions one can preview GitHub markdown blog posts while editing, be working on several blog posts on different git branches, and quickly view blog changes with a browser. . Local Repository . The local repository contains a copy the GitHub repository. Contents are edited using VScode. The GitHub repository is not directly modified. It is modified after edited files are saved, staged, a message is added, and pushed to the GitHub repository . One can use the built-in VScode terminal to manually update the GitHub repository with the modified files in the local repository. . git add git commit -m &quot;message git push . The git add command stages the edited files The git commit -m “message” command adds the “why” message The git push command pushes the edited files to the GitHub repository . I prefer using the VScode built-in git interface. It is quicker to git push modified files. Microsoft owns both GitHub and VScode, so I think the odds are they work well together . The local repository is modified with the git pull command. It ensures the local repository is up to date with the GitHub repository . GitHub Chain . Fastpages relies on a cast of creative APIs and apps to compile and deploy blogs . GitHub Repository -&gt; Fastpages -&gt; GitHub Pages -&gt; Deploy Blog . GitHub notifies fastpages after a push from the local repository. fastpages prepares the blog for GitHub Pages to compile and deploy .",

Checking out what’s new or not, what’s real or not, or what’s new and improved, is something like panning for gold.
