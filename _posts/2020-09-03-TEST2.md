> This is an opinionated technology blog. Posts are about technologies that are interesting to me.

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built  blogs from scratch or used   blog technology du jour. This blog is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai). It is a tool in [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Synopsis

-  Fastpages is not plug and play. It requires

    - Experience using git

    - Experince using GitHub

    - The documentation is a guide, not step by step

My experience installing and using fastpages was worth while. I have learned things doing so.

The diagram illustrates a process for creating  fastpages posts

    <em>A Process for Creating Fastpages Posts</em>
</p>

## Fastpages Posts

[Fastpages]({{site.baseurl}}/README.md) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks]({{site.baseurl}}/),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

### Editing

My go to editor is [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com)  with the [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) extension pack. It has a nice feature for  previewing GitHub markdown 
 
Fastpages uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for creating blog. It uses [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that  has some features  other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown and embedding html

### GitHub Pages

Fastpages uses  [GitHuB Pages](https://pages.github.com), and a cast of creative APIs, and apps to compile and deploy blog.

## Git

Git and GitHub are integral to fastpages

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a key structural component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in a project's files.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform for hosting most any type of file. Think of GitHub as a platform that stores the whole codebase in a remote repository. It comes with tools to collaborate on projects of any size.
