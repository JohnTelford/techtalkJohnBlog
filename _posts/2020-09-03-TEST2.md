> **Work in Progress**

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built several blogs from scratch or using   blog technology du jour. This one is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai), which is a part of  [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Fastpages

[Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

My preference is creating posts using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  Fastpages runs on [GitHub](https://github.com),  it is relatively  easy to use, and GitHub markdown has some features that other markdown dialects do not have.

## GitHub Pages

Fastpages uses  [GitHuB Pages](https://pages.github.com), a cast of creative APIs, and apps that compile and deploy blogs.

## Synopsis

- compose blogs on your computer and save it to your local GitHub repository blob repository
- save a copy to the local GitHub repository 
- copy the local repository to the GitHub repository.
- GitHub saves all versions of the changes to the repository.
- Fastpages  automatically compiles the blog with new posting from the repository, adding the new  posting to the blog
 - links to all blog postings are added to the home page, with post title, description, and date added to the blog
- clicking a blog posting link opens the blog
- a table of contents is created for each section of the blog post 
- the top of the blog post page has links to the blog About page, a search link for the entire blog,  a link to all blog tags, and a link to the blog home page
