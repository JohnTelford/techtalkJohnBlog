> Warning: Work in Progress!

> This is an opinionated technology blog. Posts are about technologies that are interesting to me.

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built  blogs from scratch or used   blog technology du jour. This blog is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai). It is a tool in [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Synopsis

-  Fastpages is not plug and play

- It requires:

    - Experience using git

    - Experince using GitHub

- The documentation is a guide, not step by step

My experience installing and using fastpages was worth while. I have learned things also.

## Git and GitHub

Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are integral to fastpages. Fastpages relies on Github Pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation blogs 

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a key structural component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in a project's files. It helps answering the questions: Who Changed What, Where, When, and Why?

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online platform for hosting  versions of most any type of file. Think of GitHub as a platform that stores the files in a remote repository. It comes with tools to collaborate on projects of any size.

[Git Hub Pages](https://pages.github.com) are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub

## Fastpages Posts

[Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://fastpages.fast.ai),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

## VScode

My go to editor is [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com)  with the [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) extension pack. A convenient feature is  previewing GitHub markdown
 
I use VScode for blog command and control,  text editing, and interfacing with git and GitHub.

 ## Local Repository
The local repository contains a copy the GitHub repository. Contents are edited using VScode. The GitHub repository is not directly updated. It is updated after edited files are saved, staged, a message is added, and pushed  to the GitHub repository. 

One can use the built-in terminal to manually update the GitHub repository with the updated files in the local repository. The `git add` command stages the edited  files.  The `git commit -m "message"` command add the "why" message. The `git push` command pushes the edited files to the GitHub repository. I prefer using the VScode built-in GitHub interface.  It is quicker  and checks for errors. Microsoft owns both GitHub and VScode.

The local repository is updated with the `git pull` command. It ensures the local repository is  up to date with the GitHub repository. 

## GitHub Repository

The GitHub repository 

Fastpages uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for creating blog. It uses [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that  has some features  other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown and embedding html



## GitHub Pages

Fastpages uses  [GitHuB Pages](https://pages.github.com), and a cast of creative APIs, and apps to compile and deploy blog.
