 This is an opinionated technology blog

The Internet has been a part my life since its early days. Since then I have decades of hands-on experience  with some of the ever changing Internet technologies,  and a passion pursuing what’s new and improved within the computer and electronic industries

Checking out what’s new or not, what’s real or not, or what’s new and improved, in the computer and electronic industries, is something like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily by the industries, every so often one finds nuggets making the effort worthwhile.

These industries are probably the fastest changing endeavors mankind has ever created. The half life of many computer and electronic products making it to market are relatively short. There are some very short lived ones, some that were just vapor. 

The Hype Cycle helps separating fiction and reality.

- Technology Trigger  
A potential technology breakthrough happens.

- Peak of Inflated Expectations  
Early publicity produces a number of success stories and often accompanied by stories of failures. Some companies may take corrective action but most don’t.

- Trough of Disillusionment  
Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver on the hype.

- Slope of Enlightenment  
Technology consumers begin to understand the technology better and how it may benefit them.

- Plateau of Productivity  
Mainstream adoption starts to take off.

The few technologies that are well into the Plateau of Productivity stage of the hype cycle  may be experience the spiral of death by actions of creators
