 This is an opinionated technology blog. Posts are about  technologies interesting to me.


The Internet has been a part my life since its early days. I have decades of hands-on experience  with some of the ever changing Electronic, Internet, and Software technologies,  and a passion pursuing what’s new and improved within the these industries

Checking out what’s new or not, what’s real or not, or what’s new and improved,  is something like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds nuggets making the effort worthwhile.

These industries are probably the fastest changing endeavors mankind has ever created. The half life of many  products making it to market are relatively short. There are some very short lived  and some that were just vapor. 

The Hype Cycle helps separate fiction and reality.

- Technology Trigger  

A potential technology breakthrough happens.

- Peak of Inflated Expectations   
Early publicity produces a number of success stories and often accompanied by stories of failures. Some companies may take corrective action but most don’t.

- Trough of Disillusionment  
Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver on the hype.

- Slope of Enlightenment  
Technology consumers begin to understand the technology better and how it may benefit them.

- Plateau of Productivity  
Mainstream adoption starts to take off.

The few technologies that are well into the Plateau of Productivity stage of the hype cycle  may  experience the spiral of death by actions of their creators
