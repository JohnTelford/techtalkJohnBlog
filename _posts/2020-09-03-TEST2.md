Since the early days of the Internet, I have built several blogs using   blog technology du jour. This one is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai), which is a part of  [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Fastpages

[Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

My preference is creating posts using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  Fastpages runs on [GitHub](https://github.com),  it is relatively  easy to use, and GitHub markdown has some features that other markdown dialects do not have.

## GitHub Pages

Fastpages uses  [GitHuB Pages](https://pages.github.com), a cast of creative APIs and apps that compile and deploy blogs.
