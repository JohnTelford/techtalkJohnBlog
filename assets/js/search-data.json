Since the early days of the Internet, I have built blogs from scratch or used blog technology du jour. This blog is built using fastpages. It is a tool in fast.ai’s tool kit . Synopsis . “Fastpages” is not plug and play . | It requires: . Experience using “git” . | Experince using “GitHub” . | . | The documentation is a guide, not step by step . | . My experience installing and using “fastpages” was worth while. I have learned things also . Git and GitHub . “Git”, “GitHub”, and “GitHub Pages” are integral to “fastpages”. “Fastpages” relies on “GitHub” for hosting the blog repository, “Github Pages” to compile and deploy the blog, and “Github Actions” for blog creation automation . Git is a key structural component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in a project’s files. It helps answering the questions: Who Changed What, Where, When, and Why? . GitHub is an online platform for hosting versions of most any type of file. “GitHub” as a platform for storing files in a remote repository. It comes with tools for project collaboration . Git Hub Pages creates and deploys public web pages . Some Helpful Resources . Git and GitHub in a Nutshell: Definitive tutorial for beginners . Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub . From Edits to Web Blog . The diagram illustrates creating blog posts from editing to deploying blogs . . A Process for Creating Fastpages Posts . Fastpages Posts . Fastpages supports creating blog post using Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Microsoft Word . “Fastpages” uses GitHub Pages to create and deploy blogs. It uses GitHub Markdown for editing blog post text. It has some features that other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown, and supporting embedding HTML . VScode . VScode is my go-to editor for blog command and control, text editing, and interfacing with “git” and “GitHub”. The Github Markdown Preview extension pack is convenient for previewing “GitHub” markdown blog posts while typing . The “VScode” Docker Extension enables previewing the entire fastpages blog. This is a much faster way of seeing blog changes than pushing them to the “GitHub” Repository . Local Repository . The local repository contains a copy the “GitHub” repository. Contents are edited using “VScode”. The “GitHub” repository is not directly updated. It is updated after edited files are saved, staged, a message is added, and pushed to the “GitHub” repository . One can use the built-in VScode terminal to manually update the “GitHub” repository with the updated files in the local repository. The git add command stages the edited files. The git commit -m &quot;message&quot; command adds the “why” message. The git push command pushes the edited files to the “GitHub” repository. I prefer using the “VScode” built-in “GitHub” interface. It is quicker to push file changes. Microsoft owns both “GitHub” and “VScode” . The local repository is updated with the git pull command. It ensures the local repository is up to date with the “GitHub” repository . GitHub Chain . “Fastpages” relies on a cast of creative APIs and apps to compile and deploy blogs . “GitHub Repository” -&gt; “Fastpages” -&gt; “Github Pages” -&gt; Deploy Blog . “GitHub” notifies “fastpages” after a push from the local repository. “Fastpages” prepares the blog for “GitHub Pages” to compile and deploy .",

The Internet has been a part my life since its early days.

Checking out what’s new or not, what’s real or not, or what’s new and improved, is something like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds nuggets making the effort worthwhile. .
