Since the early days of the Internet, I have built blogs from scratch or used blog technology du jour. This blog is built using fastpages, a tool in fast.ai’s tool kit . How fitting.

Fastpages supports creating blog post using Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Microsoft Word . Fastpages uses GitHub Pages to create and deploy blogs. It uses GitHub Markdown for editing blog post text. It has some features that other markdown dialects may not have, like commenting out lines of markdown, and supporting embedding HTML . VScode . VScode is my go-to editor for blog command and control, text editing, and interfacing with git and GitHub. The Github Markdown Preview extension pack is convenient for previewing GitHub markdown blog posts while typing . The VScode Docker Extension enables previewing the entire fastpages blog. This is a much faster way to see blog changes than pushing them to the GitHub Repository . Local Repository . The local repository contains a copy the GitHub repository. Contents are edited using VScode. The GitHub repository is not directly updated. It is updated after edited files are saved, staged, a message is added, and pushed to the GitHub repository . One can use the built-in VScode terminal to manually update the GitHub repository with the updated files in the local repository. The git add command stages the edited files. The git commit -m &quot;message&quot; command adds the “why” message. The git push command pushes the edited files to the GitHub repository. I prefer using the VScode built-in git interface. It is quicker to push file changes. Microsoft owns both GitHub and VScode . The local repository is updated with the git pull command. It ensures the local repository is up to date with the GitHub repository . GitHub Chain . Fastpages relies on a cast of creative APIs and apps to compile and deploy blogs . GitHub Repository -&gt; Fastpages -&gt; GitHub Pages -&gt; Deploy Blog . GitHub notifies fastpages after a push from the local repository. fastpages prepares the blog for GitHub Pages to compile and deploy .",
