> ***Warning:*** Work in Progress!

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built several blogs from scratch or using   blog technology du jour. This one is built using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai), which is a part of  [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)'s tool kit. 

## Fastpages

[Fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html) supports creating blog post using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Microsoft Word.

My preference is creating posts using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  Fastpages runs on [GitHub](https://github.com),  it is relatively  easy to use, and GitHub markdown has some features that other markdown dialects do not have.

This diagram illustrates creating  fastpages posts 

## GitHub Pages

Fastpages uses  [GitHuB Pages](https://pages.github.com), a cast of creative APIs, and apps that compile and deploy blogs.

## Synopsis

- compose blogs on your computer and save it to your local GitHub repository blog repository

- save a copy to the local GitHub repository to the GitHub repository.

- GitHub saves all versions of the changes to the repository.

- information about who changed what, when, where, and why, is stored in repository 

- Fastpages  automatically compiles  blog  posting from the repository

- the top of the blog post page has links to the blog About page, a search link for the entire blog,  a link to all blog tags, and a link to the blog home page

 - links to all blog postings are added to the blog home page, with post title, description, and date added to the blog

- clicking a blog posting link opens the posting

- a table of contents is 
shown for each section of the blog post
